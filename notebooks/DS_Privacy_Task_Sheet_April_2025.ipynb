    "On the following pages is an exercise to give you a flavor of topics which will concern you as a Privacy Solutions data scientist. Your answers will show us something of the way you work and think as well as how well you communicate. When in doubt about how to proceed, please use your best judgment. We do require that your answers are entirely your own work and that you cite where any external resources are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addressing the exercises, you should use R or Python. Your answers should include the code used to produce your findings. Where you describe your findings, do so in a non-technical way, being careful with wording. The reader should not need to execute your code to see your answers.\n",

It would also be helfpul if you also submit either a pdf or html of the same notebook. Send your submission by attaching the files in an email to the address that you received this exercise from."

Where a question is open-ended, it is encouraged that you are succinct in your explanation.\n",

    "The following questions involve the downloading and joining of two datasets. This is open source data available on the internet which is a few years out of date. Read through the whole of the question first so you can remove any columns from the data that are not required in advance. The dataset at https://tinyurl.com/TaskDataA has a number of variables including population by 5-digit ZIP code for (nearly) the whole of the USA (a fairly poor data dictionary can be downloaded here: https://tinyurl.com/TaskDataADesc). Zip code, or more properly ZCTA (Zip code tabulation area) is the ninth column. This dataset, however, does not have the US state of each ZIP code (despite the description implying it might), but the one at https://tinyurl.com/TaskDataZ does (ZCTA is the second column), so download and (inner) join the datasets.\n",

    "Part of our work at Privacy Hub involves applying industry-standard guidance to various real life use cases. Such guidance often takes the form of modifications to a dataset in the name of reducing risk of re-identification. Sometimes the application of the standard guidance is a sensible approach. Other times, however, we use this guidance as a starting point, and modify or refine it in order to strengthen privacy protection or enable a higher degree of utility from the data.\n",
